# Emonation

A React/Node.js/MongoDB website in which users can log-in via Google Auth and place a marker on an emotional landscape representing where they are emotionally. A new form of social network where you can see how your friends are doing and share how you are feeling, but in a fun, interactive, and relatable way!
